							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As a senior software engineering student I've done a lot of projects based on a script or pre-defined
						plan of action. This set of enhancements, however, presents that I can plan and execture on project improvements
						within a set time frame. In 6 weeks I analyzed my old code and found areas of improvement, made a comprehensive plan 
						to make the code more up to date and upgrading its functionality, and executed on these plans. Having completed this 
						task I feel I've sharpened skills that are highly useful for being a developer. My organizational skill, fundamental 
						understanding of how modular code works together, and the implementation and manipulation of seperate tools and code 
						to achieve a plan that may change and adjust as the project progresses. The goal of this assignment was to achieve 
						five course outcomes:
						<ol>
						 <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science</li>
						 <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts</li>
						 <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices</li>
						 <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals</li>
						 <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources</li>
						</ol>
						Throughout this assessment I'll explain which of these goals I feel I achieved and how I achieved them.</p>

								<h2>Original Code</h2>

							<a href="https://github.com/TylerStrickland332/Weight-Tracking-App" download>The original project</a> was made in Winter 2023 for 
							my mobile development class. The goal of the project was to create a mobile app in kotlin + 
							java that can record weights in relation to dates. Below you'll find my original code review 
							of this project where I go into details of my planned enhancements of the following three catergories: 
							Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases

							<p><a href="https://github.com/TylerStrickland332/CS-499-Capstone-and-ePortfolio">The improved code</a> was improved with the <a href="#portfolio">three prior mentioned </a> 
							focus areas in mind. Below are the explanations of how each area was improved, the challenges I faced with each, and how the I did/didn't achieve my expected course outcomes.</p>
							<p>Link to improvement repository is linked above.</p>
							<p>Software Design and Engineering: I implemented the use of the home device's calendar so that it has the possibilty to be used offline, as opposed to Google API's.</p>
							<p>Algorithms and Datastructures: Introduction of UserID numbers to make securing data more effective, increasing security and ensuring you don't lose your data if you change your username.</p>
							<p>Databases: Use of userIDs to improve search capabilities of user data that could greatly cut down search time in large-scale deployment of the app.</p>
