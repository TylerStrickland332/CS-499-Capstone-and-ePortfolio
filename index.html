							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As a senior software engineering student I've done a lot of projects based on a script or pre-defined
						plan of action. This set of enhancements, however, presents that I can plan and execture on project improvements
						within a set time frame. In 6 weeks I analyzed my old code and found areas of improvement, made a comprehensive plan 
						to make the code more up to date and upgrading its functionality, and executed on these plans. Having completed this 
						task I feel I've sharpened skills that are highly useful for being a developer. My organizational skill, a deeper fundamental 
						understanding of how modular code works together and can be modified, and the implementation and manipulation of seperate tools and code 
						to achieve a plan that may change and adjust as the project progresses. Alongside this project, an outside example can be seen in my 
						Analysis of Run Time repository where I use the skills there to improve my search algorithm for this database. The skills I learned in my 
						DriverPass repository helped plan the project from where it was in development to where I wanted it to be. In my classes I have yet to collaborate as a team, 
						however I have participated in GameJams in which I collaborate with randomly chosen fellow developers to create a final product in the form of a game. I've  
						expressed my ability to communicate with stakeholdsers in my DriverPass repository where I was tasked to explain how the system would need to function in 
						very technically-light terms while still being effective. I feel my ability to improve and produce algorithms is improving as I am currently making a personal 
						passion project in the form of a game with Unreal Engine 5, a platform that provides block code and thus the entirety of the operation relies on your understanding
						of algorithms and data structures as some data needs to be initialized in a certain order for it to function correctly. Software engineering is something I personally am
						trying to improve on when it comes to other's code, this project helped a lot with that since I made the original project almost a year ago now I had to 
						by hand read and review the code to understand it's functionality and where it could be improved. Security I also improved upon in this project, having implemented 
						some password safety features such as minimum and maximum lengths and the implmentation of a UserID that will ensure usernames can't be manipulated to steal other's information. 
						The artifact I'll be using in this portfolio to give a brief presentation of my skills is a mobile app that was made in Winter 2023 that saves weights in accordance to a date.
						 This app was improved to demonstrate my capabilities and accomplish the following  
						five course outcomes:
						<ol>
						 <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science</li>
						 <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts</li>
						 <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices</li>
						 <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals</li>
						 <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources</li>
						</ol>
						Throughout this portfoloio I'll explain which of these goals I feel I achieved and how I achieved them.</p>

								<h2>Original Code</h2>

							<a href="https://github.com/TylerStrickland332/Weight-Tracking-App" download>The original project</a> was made in Winter 2023 for 
							my mobile development class. The goal of the project was to create a mobile app in kotlin + 
							java that can record weights in relation to dates. Below you'll find my original code review 
							of this project where I go into details of my planned enhancements of the following three catergories: 
							Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases

								<h2>Improvements</h2>

							<p><a href="https://github.com/TylerStrickland332/CS-499-Capstone-and-ePortfolio">The improved code</a> was improved with the <a href="#portfolio">three prior mentioned </a> 
							focus areas in mind. Below are the explanations of how each area was improved, the challenges I faced with each, and how the I did/didn't achieve my expected course outcomes.</p>
							<p>Link to improvement repository is linked above.</p>
							<p>Software Design and Engineering: I implemented the use of the home device's calendar so that it has the possibilty to be used offline, as opposed to Google API's.</p>
							<p>Algorithms and Datastructures: Introduction of UserID numbers to make securing data more effective, increasing security and ensuring you don't lose your data if you change your username.</p>
							<p>Databases: Use of userIDs to improve search capabilities of user data that could greatly cut down search time in large-scale deployment of the app.</p>
